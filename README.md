# Charity Website

Many charities just need a website which contains static content. They should not be paying Â£10-15 per month to host their website.

I have a friend who started her own charity and was looking to make a website. I thought it'd be a great idea to improve my web development skills - so I took on the job. Ultimately, she now has a website, where she can edit the content, but which does not cost her anything per month. All she need to do is pay for the renewal of the domain, annually.
