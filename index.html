        <h1>About Sean</h1>
        <br>
        <p>In 2021, Sean was experiencing some difficulties with his Mental Health. While he was proactive with trying to seek support and a diagnosis, 
          he was not aware of the numerous resources available to him to support him on his MH journey.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Sean was a kind lad, always making the time to support others who were struggling with their own issues - in spite of having struggles of his own. 
          It just came naturally to him to want to help others. Sean died on 4th December 2021. He was 17.    
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Unfortunately, Sean never had the chance to access the support that would have made the world of difference to him; largely owing to the fact that 
          the resources he needed were not readily available to him.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>We are now Sean's voice. In his name, we will help others access the support they need as well as provide a space for people to open up and talk 
          about what they are going through. This is Sean's legacy.
        </p>

        <h1>Meet the team: Fiona</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, I'm Fiona. As soon as I met Sean's family, I knew I wanted to be involved in this well needed project, 
          as I know how difficult it can be to get the support you need. After struggling with my own mental health throughout my life, 
          I have now managed to find ways of coping and I'm lucky to have a really supportive family - that's my Husband, my rock, in the picture.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I previously worked in childcare and education for over 20 years and my main focus was behavioural/learning difficulties and supporting 
          neurodiversity in young children.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I do voluntary work with various local charities and now Sean's Safe Space too. Over the past few months, I have completed training in 
          Suicide and Self Harm Prevention & Awareness and Adverse Childhood Experiences. I'm currently studying Mental Health in Early Years and 
          also further training in Domestic Violence.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>My aim is to be able to provide useful resources, a listening ear and the support from someone who genuinely understands how challenging 
          it is to struggle with mental health
        </p>

        <h1>Meet the team: Kev</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Kev is Sean's Dad. He feels that he is now in a good place to be able to support those in need in Gosport.</p>

        <br>

        <p>An advocate of helping people to find their way, Kev has a wealth of coaching experience from his varied career. As a veteran, 
          he understands the issues that ex-service people can experience while completing their transition back into civilian life.</p>
          
        <br>
     
        <p>Being involved in Sean's Safe Space is a fitting way to remember his son - who also helped others</p>

        <br>

        <p>Jamie has experienced numerous Mental Health issues in his adult life - including depression, anxiety, and addiction. 
          Since suffering a breakdown, he has spent the last 6+ years working with Vulnerable People.
